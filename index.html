          <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
          <p>Here are the projects of mine, just give it a try!</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to my corner of the web. This is more than just a personal
            portfolio ‚Äî it‚Äôs a dynamic space where ideas turn into projects, and
            curiosity evolves into real-world applications. Whether you're here
            to explore what I've built, check out what I'm working on, or simply
            get a sense of how I approach software development, you're in the
            right place. Everything you see here reflects both where I‚Äôve been
            and where I‚Äôm heading. From simple interface designs to long-term
            application ideas, this site holds the blueprint of my growth. Some
            features are still under construction ‚Äî because learning never
            really stops. Stick around, click through, and explore. You might
            discover a project that inspires you, or even one you want to build
            with me.

            <h1>Ai Development</h1>
            <p>
              Artificial Intelligence is not just about mimicking human thinking
              ‚Äî it's about expanding the boundaries of what we think is
              possible. I'm actively exploring areas like image processing,
              natural language understanding, and machine learning. My goal is
              to build intelligent systems that feel intuitive and helpful in
              real-life situations. For me, AI isn't a passing trend; it's a
              fundamental shift in how we solve problems and design the future.

            <h1>Full-Stack Development</h1>
            <p>
              To build strong AI applications, I believe you need full control
              of the software pipeline. That‚Äôs why I focus on full stack
              development. On the frontend, I aim to create clean, user-focused
              interfaces, while on the backend I work on efficient data handling
              and API integration. This foundation allows me to bring my AI
              ideas to life without relying heavily on others ‚Äî I can go from
              concept to deployment on my own.

            <h1>Car Industry and Developments</h1>
            <p>
              Cars are more than transportation ‚Äî they‚Äôre where hardware and
              software meet in the real world. I‚Äôve been researching how smart
              systems are being integrated into vehicles, from autonomous
              driving tech to digital dashboards and UX design. The automotive
              industry fascinates me not just for its complexity, but for how
              much potential there is for innovation. It‚Äôs a field I hope to
              contribute to in the near future.

            <h1>Kitap Blogum Project</h1>
            <p>
              I started this project out of a very simple need: to remember and
              revisit the lines that impacted me in books. ‚ÄúKitap Blogum‚Äù lets
              users save personal notes tied to specific pages, creating a
              searchable, personalized reading archive. Over time, I plan to
              expand it into a social platform, where people can share
              highlights, recommend books, and see what others are reading. It‚Äôs
              where reading meets digital reflection.

              I have done my 1. grade of university. A year while getting ready to learn what is software, what is a software program, what is an algorithm, how we develop and how we make a secure website.

              This project was given to us from our User Interface teacher. We made a website which gives our user suggestions about What to Watch. We seperated the movies via their kind, we also worked on giving you the details as the IMDB point, topic, release date and how long. It's a static website.
